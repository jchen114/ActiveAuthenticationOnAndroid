# Active Authentication on Android
An application which starts services that capture/monitor
- camera
- microphone
- accelerometer
- rotation
- application processes
- wifi
- bluetooth
- location
- temperature
- air pressure
- brightness
- proximity
- battery state
- call state
- screen state

and stores them locally to a directory then runs an authentication algorithm to get scores from each modality and fuses the
scores together to output a single authentication score.
